Part A
Assignment 01

To optimized the solution for mainatanability I have created an Animal interface.
So In the future if the Bird need to inject any more quilities they can be implemented easily.

Assignment 02

To achive the chicken being bird but can not fly behaviour, I have added abilities in seperate interfaces.
Then implemented them in each classes accordingly.

Assignment 03

Rooster is a Chicken. Therefore except using inheritance I have used composition.
Then overridden the speak behaviour while everyother behaviours being a chickn.

Assignment 04

By passing the "noiseAround" as an agrument to parrot speak method, I have achived  different behaviours 
of Parrot.

Part B

Assignment 01

Fish will implements SwimmingAnimal interface.

Assignment 02

With the Specialization, by using inheritance by going down to the hirachy  fish can be specialized as a Shark and as a Clownfish.

Assignment 03

We can easily implement SwimmingAnimal without inheriting from Fish.

By using inheritance, Compositoin and delegation we can achive less code duplication.
